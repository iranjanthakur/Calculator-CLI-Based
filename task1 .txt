1. Normalization – It is a process of arranging data in tables to remove duplicates.
It helps to make the database more efficient and organized.


2. Primary Key vs Foreign Key –

Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.

Foreign Key: Connects one table to another using the primary key of that table.



3. Constraints – These are rules applied to columns to control data.
Examples are NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, and PRIMARY KEY.


4. Surrogate Key – It is an artificial key used as a primary key.
Mostly it's an auto-generated number instead of real data.


5. Avoid Data Redundancy – Use normalization to split data into related tables.
Also, use proper relationships between tables to avoid duplicates.


6. ER Diagram – It is a visual diagram that shows tables and their relationships.
It helps in designing the structure of a database.


7. Types of Relationships – One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many are main types.
They define how tables are connected to each other.


8. AUTO_INCREMENT – It automatically generates the next number for a column.
Mostly used for primary key IDs in MySQL tables.


9. Default Storage Engine in MySQL – MySQL uses InnoDB as default.
It supports transactions and relationships between tables.


10. Composite Key – A key made from two or more columns together.
Used when a single column cannot uniquely identify a record.
