## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd python-calculator
```

3. Run the calculator:
```bash
python calculator.py
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Run the program
2. Choose an operation from the menu (1-5)
3. Enter two numbers when prompted
4. View your result
5. Select option 5 to exit

### Example Usage

```
========================================

## 🔧 Functions

The calculator includes the following functions:

- `add(a, b)` - Returns the sum of two numbers
- `sub(a, b)` - Returns the difference of two numbers
- `mul(a, b)` - Returns the product of two numbers
- `div(a, b)` - Returns the quotient of two numbers

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Division by zero is not currently handled
- Only accepts integer inputs
- Limited error handling for non-numeric inputs

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add division by zero error handling
- [ ] Support for floating-point numbers
- [ ] Add more advanced operations (power, square root, etc.)
- [ ] Implement calculation history
- [ ] Add input validation for non-numeric entries
